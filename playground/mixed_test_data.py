As doubt and disorder overtake her world, the fallen Angel must face her fears to unify the gods of PARADISE and defy the beast that stalks them. Told through a blend of aerial and acrobatic dance alongside vogue, hip hop and film, this epic finale features a stellar cast of queer and trans performing artists of color.\n\nPARADISE is co-produced by India Sky Davis and Indi McCasey, directed by Davis and Gabriel Christian and features Davis and former Cirque du Soleil performer Marshall Jarreau, alongside artists including Kiebpoli Calnek, Brandon Kazen-Maddox, Davia Spain, The Lady Ms. Vagina Jenkins, and Saturn Rising.'\n\nCelebrating its 6th year as part of the National Queer Arts Festival, Topsy-Turvy Queer Circus organizes multidisciplinary circus arts productions that challenge and subvert traditional ideals of beauty, gender, sexuality and power.
